\section{Event Overview}

Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is the UK's largest technology-focused camping
festival: A non-profit three-day event for those with an inquisitive mind and
an interest in science, engineering, technology, crafts, DIY, and computer
security. EMF 2018 is the fourth major camping festival organised by
Electromagnetic Field Ltd.

Held every two years, EMF can be seen as a cross between a conference and a
festival, with talks and workshops on a wide range of subjects across a series
of marquee-based stages. EMF is a uniquely community-run event, with attendees
grouping into "villages" around shared interests. Villages run their own
workshops, talks, and installations in addition to those run by EMF itself.

Our last event in 2016 brought 1900 attendees to a site near Guildford for
talks and workshops on topics ranging from genetic modification to electronics,
blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering to lock picking,
computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to beer brewing.

\subsection{Demographic}

EMF events have historically attracted a broad spectrum of attendees due to the
variety of talks and workshops available. The audience demographic is expected
to range in age between 18 and 50, with the majority of attendees being between
22 and 35, and a slight male bias.

EMF is a family-friendly event with activities for children, and in 2016 there
were a significant number of families attending -- a number which we expect to
improve on again in 2018.

\section{Management}

Electromagnetic Field is an entirely volunteer-run event, with all staff
volunteering signficant amounts of their time to organise the event, and many
attendees volunteering some of their time to make the event happen.

We strive to operate EMF to a standard equivalent to professionally-run events.
Many of the organising team have significant experience at previous EMF events,
as well as several similar events held across Europe.

Overall responsibility for the operation of the event lies with the Directors
of Electromagnetic Field, Russ Garrett and Jonty Wareing.

Those volunteers involved in running the event are formed into teams, with each
team having an experienced lead and a deputy lead who are accountable for that
team.

Organisational meetings of all team leads (the ``organising team'') are held
periodically prior to the event.  During the event, meetings of the organising
team will be held daily to deal with any issues arising.

At all times during the public opening hours of the event, an experienced member
of the organising team will be on call as the ``duty site manager'' with
ultimate responsibility for event operations.

\section{Site}

The event will be located in grassland at Eastnor Castle Deer Park. EMF has an
agreement to use the site between Friday 24\superscript{th} August and Thursday
6\superscript{th} September.

Where not otherwise secure, the site will be surrounded by a Heras-style fence
for security purposes.  This perimeter will surround the event tents and all
camping areas. All licensable activities will happen within this perimeter.

The entrance gate will be staffed 24 hours per day, and tickets will be
exchanged for wristbands on entry.

Further detail of the site layout, including the locations of tents, toilets,
and water supply, can be found on the site plan in Appendix~\ref{site-plan}.

\section{Licensing}

EMF is in the process of applying for a premises license from Herefordshire
Borough Council.

The Designated Premises Supervisor is Russ Garrett.

\subsection{Alcohol Sales}

The bar will be operated by EMF and staffed by volunteers. All bar staff will
receive training on legislation and event policies before starting work. The
bar will operate a ``Challenge 21'' policy for dealing with under-18s, and will
only accept approved documents as proof of age. Bar staff will be instructed
not to serve customers who are drunk, and will be familiarised with the
strength of the drinks they are serving.

Volunteer bar staff will be required to complete training on the legal
responsibilities of alcohol sales prior to undertaking any sale of alcohol
on the premises.

A full price list will be provided at each bar, which will include the ABV
levels of each drink and the measured quantity in which spirits are being sold.

Drinks will not be served in glass containers. Attendees will be requested not to
bring glass onto the site.

Previous events have had no recorded alcohol-related disorder, and we do not
expect this event to be any different.

Alcohol sales for EMF will be overseen by Russ Garrett and Steve Early who
hold personal licenses.

\subsection{Regulated Entertainment}

The main focus of EMF is talks and workshops, however the event will provide
some live music and DJs, as well as ancillary recorded music between talks.
Music is a secondary focus of the event, and will not be a major component of
any promotion or advertising.

EMF will operate a curfew for music performances of 02:00 (23:00 on Sunday),
with performances scheduled to finish 30 minutes earlier to allow for overruns.

Further information on EMF's noise management policy can be found in
section~\ref{noise}.

\subsection{Public Nuisance}

The event site is not in direct proximity to any residential areas.

EMF is a camping festival, and no day tickets will be on sale. The majority of
attendees are not expected to leave the site during the event. Previous events
have had no recorded incidents of public nuisance.

Because of this, we consider that there is a low risk of attendees causing
public nuisance outside the site.

\section{Noise}
\label{noise}
We are mindful of the need to keep noise nuisance to an absolute minimum and
EMF will cooperate fully with site management, Environmental Health, and local
residents to achieve this.

Programmed music performances will be confined to one of the main tents
(approximately 12x24m in size), and will be oriented to direct sound away from
residential areas. Due to the comparatively small audience size, sound levels
can be kept low and easily controllable.

Staff involved with noise monitoring, the duty site manager, and staff at any
locations within the site using amplified music will be in radio contact and
instructed to effectively and swiftly reduce noise levels if necessary.

Local residents and Environmental Health will be provided with 24/7 contact
details for the site office in case of an issue with noise.

Due to the nature of the event, it is unavoidable that some attendees will
bring sound systems.  The organisers will endeavour to ensure that any
amplified music played by attendees is inaudible at noise-sensitive boundaries
outside of the licensed hours, and sanctions will be imposed to enforce this.

\section{Children}

The event will be family-friendly with a dedicated children's area. Under-5s will receive free tickets
and under-16s will receive a discount.

All reasonable efforts shall be made to ensure that there are no unaccompanied under-16s on site.

A DBS-checked volunteer will always be on-call in case of a lost child situation. The lost child
policy can be found in Appendix~\ref{lost-child-policy}.

\section{Water}
Mains water is available on site from several standpipes. Taps and washbasins will be provided by EMF.

All temporary water installation will be in compliance with BS8551 and water authority regulations.

In the event of a water supply failure, an emergency agreement will be in place with a water supplier.

\section{Toilets \& Sanitation}

As there are no toilet facilities on site, a minimum of 25 toilets and 5 urinals,
as well as two disabled toilets, will be provided by an external supplier. This
is well in excess of the recommendations made by the Event Safety Guide.

Showers will also be provided.

Greywater will be stored in existing septic tanks on site and as far as is practical
will not be allowed to run onto the ground and into watercourses.

\section{Food}

Food on site will be provided by commercial food concessions. Food hygiene certificates,
risk assessments, and insurance details will be checked and kept on file for all food
concessions, and will be made available to site management and Environmental Health before
the event on request.

\section{Staffing}

As is common with similar events, we aim to provide as many staff as possible
by asking attendees to volunteer. All stewarding will be overseen by an
experienced stewarding co-ordinator.

\subsection{Staffing Levels}

Staff levels will be allocated as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Role & Period & Staff \\
\hline
Main Gate & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Information Point & 24/7 & \\
Roving & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Bar & Licensed Hours & 2 -- 5 \\
Per Tent & During Talks & 2 \\
Control & 24/7 & 1
\end{tabular}

As well as these staff, a dedicated duty event manager will be on call at all times during the event.

In the unlikely event staffing levels cannot be guaranteed, external stewarding services will be sought.

\section{Communication}

\subsection{Radio}
All key members of staff will be issued with a radio and a contact list, and
will be trained in its use.

A ``control'' member of staff within the site office will be contactable by
radio at all times and will have emergency contact details for the organisation
team.

\subsection{Telephone}
A number of fixed and mobile phones will be available at the site office so
contact telephone numbers can be made available to external parties and staff
who may be out of radio range. Telephone numbers will be easily re-routed to
staff mobile telephones in case of emergency.

\subsection{Emergency Communications}
Public information shall be capable of being broadcast at all stages by the
stage managers. Loud hailers will be available for use by relevant staff to
give information directly to attendees.

\section{First Aid}

First aid will be provided by EMF's own team of experienced volunteers,
which include those with advanced St John Ambulance qualifications and previous
experience in large-scale festival first aid, as well as practicing doctors.

During setup and teardown there will be at least one qualified first-aider on
duty. During the licensed period, there will be at least four qualified first
aiders on duty at all times.

Further information on first aid can be found in the first aid policy in
Appendix~\ref{first-aid-policy}.

\section{Transport and Parking}

Attendees will be encouraged to use public transport or car-share as much as
possible. Car parking on site will be ticketed, and vehicles will not be
allowed on site without a pass. A shuttle bus service will be provided between
the site and Ledbury station.

Approximately 700-900 vehicles are expected to park on site, and the capacity
available for car parking is well in excess of this.

The vehicle entrance for attendees will be the main deer park entrance, east of
Eastnor on the A438. This will provide approximately 1km of vehicle queueing
capacity on private roads within the deer park.

The maximum rate of vehicle arrival is expected to be 60-80 vehicles per hour
for a short period on Friday morning. Sufficient stewarding capacity will be
provided to ensure all vehicles are promptly parked as they arrive to keep any
queueing on public roads to a minimum.

\subsection{On-Site Vehicle Safety}

Vehicle movements within the perimeter fence will be restricted to essential
journeys during peak hours (11:00--23:00) and co-ordinated by radio. No
un-marshalled vehicles will be allowed to move during peak hours.

Only competent members of staff will be allowed to use site plant. Their
training and certification will be checked before the event.

\section{Electrical Installations and Lighting}

There is no existing mains electrical supply on site. All electricity will be
supplied from a temporary electrical system provided by EMF.

The temporary electrical system will consist of pre-tested, modular units
provided by a reputable temporary event power supplier. The system will be
installed and tested by EMF staff, with assistance from external contractors
where required.

The electrical system will be installed, tested, and operated by competent
persons in accordance with BS7909:2011 (\textit{Code of practice for temporary
electrical systems for entertainment and related purposes}) and the latest
BS7671 wiring regulations.

All final circuits rated less than 32A will be protected by 30mA, 10ms Residual
Current Devices (RCDs).  All other circuits, except those run through secure
staff-only areas, shall be protected by RCDs with ratings chosen to maximise
protection which keeping nuisance trips to a minimum.

\subsection{Lighting}
General site lighting will be provided by festoon-style lighting along paths,
with floodlights provided where necessary.

Lighting on primary throughfares will be dual-fed from two separate generators
to maintain lighting during the failure of one generator.

\section{Emergencies}
Contingencies which may require the use of the emergency plan include (in
approximate order of likelihood):

\begin{itemize}
  \item Severe weather
  \item Fire
  \item Major accident/illness
  \item Collapse of structures
  \item Bomb/terrorist threat
\end{itemize}

In the event that an emergency situation develops, procedures will be in place
to ensure that it is promptly escalated to the Duty Site Manager who will assume
overall control of the incident, assisted by other members of the organising
team as necessary.

If an announcement needs to be made to attendees, the incident team is able to
ensure announcements are made via PA systems, loudhailers, and online channels.

It is the Duty Site Manager's responsibility to ensure that the emergency services
are called if necessary.

\subsection{Major Incidents}
A major incident is any emergency which puts a significant number of people at risk
of harm and/or requires the large-scale assistance of the emergency services.

The decision to declare a major incident will be made by the incident team in
consultation with the emergency services.

Once a major incident is declared, control over staff on site will be transferred
to the emergency services until the major incident has ended.

\subsection{Evacuation}
Due to the size of the site and provision of fire lanes, a full evacuation of the site
is unlikely to be required.

If necessary, announcements will be made to evacuate attendees to another part of the
site, and the incident area cordoned off.

In the unlikely event of a full evacuation being needed, emergency gates will be used
to facilitate fast evacuation.

\section{Fire}
\label{fire}
\subsection{Sources of ignition}

The main sources of ignition at EMF are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hot exhaust from generators
\item LPG appliances in catering area
\item Camp fires and gas appliances used by attendees
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps to minimise risk}
The following steps will be taken to mitigate risks of fire:

\begin{itemize}
\item Generators provided by EMF will be sited away from all combustible materials in accordance with supplier's guidance.
\item No other generators will be allowed on site.
\item Combustible materials will be stored away from structures.
\item All LPG cylinders which are not in use will be stored in a fenced enclosure at least 5m away from any structures.
\item Temporary structures will be sourced from reputable suppliers and have appropriate fire safety certification.
\item Firefighting equipment will be provided on site and staff made aware of its location. Fire extinguishers will be sited in all event tents.
\item Fire lanes will be provisioned within camping areas, clearly marked, and enforced.
\item Camp fires will not be allowed on the ground.
\item Attendees will be instructed not to use gas appliances in tents.
\item Roving staff will be instructed to monitor the site for any fire hazards and contact control over radio.
\item Catering/concessions staff will be made aware of regulations regarding gas storage.
\item Catering area will be sited well away from camping area.
\item Sufficient access to the site will be provided and maintained clear for access of fire appliances.
\item Weather conditions will be monitored in case of very dry conditions raising the risk of spread of fire through vegetation.
\end{itemize}

All stewards will be briefed on steps to take if a fire is discovered which
will include alerting other staff by radio and, if necessary, evacuating
attendees.
