\section{Event Overview}

Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is the UK's largest technology-focused camping
festival: A non-profit three-day event for those with an inquisitive mind and
an interest in science, engineering, technology, crafts, DIY, and computer
security. EMF 2018 is the fourth major camping festival organised by
Electromagnetic Field Ltd.

Held every two years, EMF can be seen as a cross between a conference and a
festival, with talks and workshops on a wide range of subjects across a series
of marquee-based stages. EMF is a uniquely community-run event, with attendees
grouping into "villages" around shared interests. Villages run their own
workshops, talks, and installations in addition to those run by EMF itself.

EMF provides a high-speed internet connection and WiFi to the entire festival.

Our last event in 2016 brought 1900 attendees to a site near Guildford for
talks and workshops on topics ranging from genetic modification to electronics,
blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering to lock picking,
computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to beer brewing.

\subsection{Demographic}

EMF events have historically attracted a broad spectrum of attendees due to the
variety of talks and workshops available. The audience demographic is expected
to range in age between 18 and 50, with the majority of attendees being between
22 and 35, and a slight male bias.

EMF is a family-friendly event with activities for children, and in 2016 there
were a significant number of families attending -- a number which we expect to
improve on again in 2018.

\section{Management}

Electromagnetic Field is an entirely volunteer-run event, with all staff
volunteering signficant amounts of their time to organise the event, and many
attendees volunteering some of their time to make the event happen.

We strive to operate EMF to a standard equivalent to professionally-run events.
Many of the organising team have significant experience at previous EMF events,
as well as several similar events held across Europe.

Overall responsibility for the operation of the event lies with the Directors
of Electromagnetic Field, Russ Garrett and Jonty Wareing.

Those volunteers involved in running the event are formed into teams, with each
team having an experienced lead and a deputy lead who are accountable for that
team.

Organisational meetings of all team leads (the ``organising team'') are held
periodically prior to the event.  During the event, meetings of the organising
team will be held daily to deal with any issues arising.

At all times during the public opening hours of the event, an experienced member
of the organising team will be on call as the ``duty site manager'' with
ultimate responsibility for event operations.

\section{Site}

The event will be located in grassland at Eastnor Castle Deer Park. EMF has an
agreement to use the site between Friday 24\superscript{th} August and Thursday
6\superscript{th} September.

Where not otherwise secure, the site will be surrounded by a Heras-style fence
for security purposes.  This perimeter will surround the event tents and all
camping areas. All licensable activities will happen within this perimeter.

The entrance gate will be staffed 24 hours per day, and tickets will be
exchanged for wristbands on entry.

Further detail of the site layout, including the locations of tents, toilets,
and water supply, can be found on the site plan in Appendix~\ref{site-plan}.

\section{Licensing}

EMF is in the process of applying for a premises license from Herefordshire
Borough Council.

The Designated Premises Supervisor is Russ Garrett.

\subsection{Alcohol Sales}

The bar will be operated by EMF and staffed by volunteers. All bar staff will
receive training on legislation and event policies before starting work. The
bar will operate a ``Challenge 21'' policy for dealing with under-18s, and will
only accept approved documents as proof of age. Bar staff will be instructed
not to serve customers who are drunk, and will be familiarised with the
strength of the drinks they are serving.

Volunteer bar staff will be required to complete training on the legal
responsibilities of alcohol sales prior to undertaking any sale of alcohol
on the premises.

A full price list will be provided at each bar, which will include the ABV
levels of each drink and the measured quantity in which spirits are being sold.

Drinks will not be served in glass containers. Attendees will be requested not to
bring glass onto the site.

Previous events have had no recorded alcohol-related disorder, and we do not
expect this event to be any different.

Alcohol sales for EMF will be overseen by Russ Garrett and Steve Early who
hold personal licenses.

\subsection{Regulated Entertainment}

The main focus of EMF is talks and workshops, however the event will provide
some live music and DJs, as well as ancillary recorded music between talks.
Music is a secondary focus of the event, and will not be a major component of
any promotion or advertising.

EMF will operate a curfew for music performances of 02:00 (23:00 on Sunday),
with performances scheduled to finish 30 minutes earlier to allow for overruns.

Further information on EMF's noise management policy can be found in
section~\ref{noise}.

\subsection{Public Nuisance}

The event site is not in direct proximity to any residential areas.

EMF is a camping festival, and no day tickets will be on sale. The majority of
attendees are not expected to leave the site during the event. Previous events
have had no recorded incidents of public nuisance.

Because of this, we consider that there is a low risk of attendees causing
public nuisance outside the site.

\subsection{Prevention of Crime and Disorder}

An log will be kept at the premises, and made available on request to the Council
or the Police, which will record:

\begin{itemize}
    \item crimes reported to the venue
    \item ejections of attendees
    \item incidents of disorder
    \item visits by a relevant authority or emergency service
    \item changes of Duty Site Manager
\end{itemize}

Attendees will be advised not to leave valuables in their cars, and a secure property
lock-up will be provided on the site.

\section{Noise}
\label{noise}
We are mindful of the need to keep noise nuisance to an absolute minimum and
EMF will cooperate fully with site management, Environmental Health, and local
residents to achieve this.

Programmed music performances will be confined to one of the main tents
(approximately 12x24m in size), and will be oriented to direct sound away from
residential areas. Due to the comparatively small audience size, sound levels
can be kept low and easily controllable.

Staff involved with noise monitoring, the duty site manager, and staff at any
locations within the site using amplified music will be in radio contact and
instructed to effectively and swiftly reduce noise levels if necessary.

Local residents and Environmental Health will be provided with 24/7 contact
details for the event control in case of an issue with noise.

Due to the nature of the event, it is unavoidable that some attendees will
bring sound systems.  The organisers will endeavour to ensure that any
amplified music played by attendees is inaudible at noise-sensitive boundaries
outside of the licensed hours, and sanctions will be imposed to enforce this.

\section{Children and Young People}

The event will be family-friendly with a dedicated children's area. Under-5s will receive free tickets
and under-16s will receive a discount.

All reasonable efforts shall be made to ensure that there are no unaccompanied under-16s on site.

A DBS-checked volunteer will always be on-call in case of a lost child situation. The lost child
policy can be found in Appendix~\ref{lost-child-policy}.

\section{Water}
Mains water is available on site from several standpipes. Taps and washbasins will be provided by EMF.

All temporary water installation will be in compliance with BS8551 and water authority regulations.

In the event of a water supply failure, an emergency agreement will be in place with a water supplier.

\section{Toilets \& Sanitation}

As there are no toilet facilities on site, a minimum of 25 toilets and 5 urinals,
as well as two disabled toilets, will be provided by an external supplier. This
is well in excess of the recommendations made by the Event Safety Guide.

Showers will also be provided.

Greywater will be stored in existing septic tanks on site and as far as is practical
will not be allowed to run onto the ground and into watercourses.

\section{Food}

Food on site will be provided by commercial food concessions. Food hygiene certificates,
risk assessments, and insurance details will be checked and kept on file for all food
concessions, and will be made available to site management and Environmental Health before
the event on request.

\section{Staffing}

As is common with similar events, we aim to provide as many staff as possible
by asking attendees to volunteer. All stewarding will be overseen by an
experienced stewarding co-ordinator.

\subsection{Staffing Levels}

Staff levels will be allocated as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Role & Period & Staff \\
\hline
Main Gate & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Information Point & 24/7 & \\
Roving & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Bar & Licensed Hours & 2 -- 5 \\
Per Tent & During Talks & 2 \\
Control & 24/7 & 1
\end{tabular}

As well as these staff, a dedicated duty event manager will be on call at all times during the event.

In the unlikely event staffing levels cannot be guaranteed, external stewarding services will be sought.

\section{Communication}

\subsection{Radio}
All key members of staff, including stewards at gates and parking,
will be issued with a radio and a contact list, and will be trained in its use.

A ``control'' member of staff at event control will be contactable by
radio and telephone at all times and will have emergency contact details for the
organisation team.

\subsection{Telephone}
A number of fixed and mobile phones will be available at the event control so
contact telephone numbers can be made available to external parties and staff
who may be out of radio range. Telephone numbers will be easily re-routed to
staff mobile telephones in case of emergency.

The event also has an internal telephone network covering all major stages and
other locations within the event, which can be used for sensitive
communications.

\subsection{Communications to Attendees}\label{attendeecomms}
Public information shall be capable of being broadcast at all stages by the
stage managers. Loud hailers will be available for use by relevant staff to
give information directly to attendees.

As WiFi is available to the entire site at EMF, social media comprises a
significant part of attendee communication, and this will also be used in
emergencies as long as the internet connection is operational.

Communication to attendees before the event will be via email and social
media. Attendees must provide a valid email address when purchasing tickets.

\section{First Aid}

First aid will be provided by EMF's own team of experienced volunteers,
which include those with advanced St John Ambulance qualifications and previous
experience in large-scale festival first aid, as well as practicing doctors.

During setup and teardown there will be at least one qualified first-aider on
duty during working hours. During the licensed period, there will be at least
four qualified first aiders on duty at all times.

Further information on first aid can be found in the first aid policy in
Appendix~\ref{first-aid-policy}.

\section{Traffic Management and Parking}

Attendees will be encouraged to use public transport or car-share as much as
possible. Car parking on site will be ticketed, and vehicles will not be
allowed on site without a pass. A shuttle bus service will be provided between
the site and Ledbury station.

Approximately 800-1000 vehicles are expected to park on site, and the capacity
available for car parking is well in excess of this.

Attendees will be provided with comprehensive directions to the site in advance
of the event.

The vehicle entrance for attendees will be the main deer park entrance, east of
Eastnor on the A438. This will provide approximately 1km of vehicle queueing
capacity on private roads within the deer park. Signs marking the entrance to
the site will be placed on Eastnor's land - no signage is expected to be required
on public highways.

The maximum rate of vehicle arrival is expected to be 60-80 vehicles per hour
for a short period on Friday morning. Sufficient stewarding capacity will be
provided to ensure all vehicles are promptly parked, and no queueing is expected
on public roads.

Accurate directions to the event site will be provided to all attendees in
advance, and signs marking the site entrance will be placed on land owned by
Eastnor Castle. No signage on public roads is expected to be required.

\subsection{On-Site Vehicle Safety}

Vehicle movements within the perimeter fence will be restricted to essential
journeys during peak hours (11:00--23:00) and co-ordinated by radio. No
un-marshalled vehicles will be allowed to move during peak hours.

The main vehicle gate will be separate to the pedestrian entrance gate to
reduce interactions between pedestrians and vehicles.

Catering concessions will be able to access the site via a separate
vehicle gate.

Only competent members of staff will be allowed to use site plant. Their
training and certification will be checked before the event.

\section{Electrical Installations and Lighting}

There is no existing mains electrical supply on site. All electricity will be
supplied from a temporary electrical system provided by EMF.

The temporary electrical system will consist of pre-tested, modular units
provided by a reputable temporary event power supplier. The system will be
installed and tested by EMF staff, with assistance from external contractors
where required.

The electrical system will be installed, tested, and operated by competent
persons in accordance with BS7909:2011 (\textit{Code of practice for temporary
electrical systems for entertainment and related purposes}) and the latest
BS7671 wiring regulations.

All final circuits rated less than 32A will be protected by 30mA, 10ms Residual
Current Devices (RCDs).  All other circuits, except those run through secure
staff-only areas, shall be protected by RCDs with ratings chosen to maximise
protection which keeping nuisance trips to a minimum.

\subsection{Lighting}
General site lighting will be provided by festoon-style lighting along paths,
with floodlights provided where necessary.

Lighting on primary throughfares will be fed from two independent generators
to maintain lighting during the failure of one generator.

\section{Special Effects}
EMF welcomes attendees to bring their own installations and demonstrations.
Some of these installations may employ special effects with their own risks,
and EMF will, where reasonably possible, put straightforward processes in
place so these can be used safely. 

These special effects policies apply to all effects on site, whether provided
by EMF or attendees.

\subsection{Strobe Lighting}
EMF has previously welcomed a number of attendees with photosensitive epilepsy.
Due to the risk to those people, no discharge-style strobe lights will be allowed
on site, on stages, installations, or otherwise.

Those responsible for lighting systems which have the capability to flash brightly
at frequencies capable of triggering photosensitive epilepsy (3-50Hz) will be
informed that such effects are not permitted to be used on site.

\subsection{Lasers}
Unless otherwise authorised by EMF, all laser effects on site will be limited to
Class 1 lasers with no audience scanning or possibility of direct eye exposure.

Laser effects which do not meet the above limits must either be provided and
operated by a reputable contractor, or authorised by a person competent to
evaluate their safety. A permit will then be granted by EMF.

Unauthorised lasers, including laser pointers, must not be used on site.

If laser effects are to be used outside with scanning near or above the
horizon, a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) will be filed in advance with the Civil
Aviation Authority.

\subsection{Flame Effects}\label{flameeffects}
Flame effects have become an integral part of the atmosphere of EMF, and
we will continue to allow their safe use. The majority of flame effects
at EMF are Liquefied Petroleum Gas (propane) effects.

A full set of rules for flame effects at EMF will be provided to those
who intend to bring them. These rules are based on the comprehensive
Flame Effects Guidelines published by the Burning Man event in the USA,
with reference to the HSE publication SIM 05/2004/09 (Safe use of
liquefied petroleum gas fired stage flame effects).

A full design of the flame effect must be submitted to EMF prior to the
event. EMF will verify the design and construction of flame effects meets
these rules and issue a permit for use once it has arrived on site and
been checked.

These rules include requirements for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Construction standards to prevent gas leaks
    \item Location of effects away from people and flammable objects
    \item Provision of fire extinguishers
    \item Operating guidelines and supervision
\end{itemize}

Use of flame effects without a permit at EMF will be strictly prohibited.

\subsection{Pyrotechnics}
Pyrotechnic sepcial effects of any type will not be used at EMF.

\section{Contingencies}\label{contingencies}
Contingencies which may require the use of the emergency plan include (in
approximate order of likelihood):

\begin{itemize}
  \item Severe weather
  \item Fire
  \item Major accident/illness
  \item Collapse of structures
  \item Bomb/terrorist threat
\end{itemize}

In the event that an emergency situation develops, procedures will be in place
to ensure that it is promptly escalated to the Duty Site Manager who will assume
overall control of the incident, assisted by other members of the organising
team as necessary.

If an announcement needs to be made to attendees, the incident team is able to
ensure announcements are made via stage PA systems, loudhailers, and online channels.
There is no site-wide PA system at EMF\@. Further information on emergency communications
to attendees can be found in section~\ref{attendeecomms}.

It is the Duty Site Manager's responsibility to ensure that the emergency services
are called if necessary.

\subsection{Major Incidents}
A major incident is any emergency which puts a significant number of people at risk
of harm and/or requires the large-scale assistance of the emergency services.

The decision to declare a major incident will be made by the incident team in
consultation with the emergency services.

Once a major incident is declared, control over staff on site will be transferred
to the emergency services until the major incident has ended.

\subsection{Evacuation}
Due to the size of the site and provision of fire lanes, a full evacuation of the site
is unlikely to be required.

If necessary, announcements will be made to evacuate attendees to another part of the
site, and the incident area cordoned off.

In the unlikely event of a full evacuation being needed, emergency gates will be used
to facilitate fast evacuation.

\subsection{Severe Weather}
Severe weather, including heavy rain, high winds, and lightning, may require the event
programme to be altered or even cancelled.

Prior to and during build-up, weather forecasts will be periodically monitored to ensure
that ground conditions are acceptable. During the event, forecasts will be reviewed
daily for risks of severe weather.

Maximum wind ratings for temporary structures will be requested from suppliers and
easily accessible at event control to ensure that the management team is aware of weather
limitations.

In the event of severe weather being forecast during the event, the organising team will
be informed and weather will be monitored on a regular basis. Attendees will be warned
using the methods in section~\ref{attendeecomms} if necessary.

In the event of severe weather posing a risk to temporary structures due to wind or
lightning, an emergency situation will be declared in accordance with
section~\ref{contingencies}. The entire event programme will be halted and attendees
evacuated from those structures by stage managers with assistance from other stewards
if necessary. Depending on the nature of the severe weather, it may be appropriate to
evacuate attendees to their cars until the weather passes.

If severe weather produces conditions which will not allow the event to safely continue,
the emergency team will begin the event cancellation process detailed in
section~\ref{cancellation}.

During severe weather, especially at night, generators must not be switched off. If
necessary, circuits at risk of potential water exposure should be isolated in
order to preserve power for site lighting and essential services. During severe weather,
Lack of site lighting poses a much more significant risk than electric shock as all
circuits are RCD protected.

\subsection{Cancellation}\label{cancellation}
In some circumstances the event may have to be cancelled before or during the event.

\subsubsection{Before the Event}
If cancellation is required before the event starts, attendees will be informed by
direct email and social media. 

If cancellation happens shortly before the scheduled start of the event, staff will
be made available at the gate to inform any arrivals of the cancellation and ensure
they promptly depart.

\subsubsection{During the Event}
If cancellation is required during or very shortly before the event, those attendees
on site will be informed using the methods in section~\ref{attendeecomms}. Attendees
not yet on site will also be informed.

Once the cancellation process has started, all programmed activities on site will
cease.

In some cases it may be appropriate to keep attendees on site overnight following the
until they can depart safely. If the cancellation is due to severe weather, some
attendees may not have access to their tents, and temporary structures may be repurposed
to accommodate them.

\section{Fire}
\label{fire}
\subsection{Sources of ignition}

The main sources of ignition at EMF are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hot exhaust from generators
\item LPG appliances in catering area
\item Camp fires, BBQs, and gas appliances used by attendees
\item Flame effects/pyrotechnics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps to minimise risk}
The following steps will be taken to mitigate risks of fire:

\begin{itemize}
\item Generators provided by EMF will be sited away from all combustible materials in accordance with supplier's guidance.
\item No other generators will be allowed on site.
\item Combustible materials will be stored away from structures.
\item All LPG cylinders which are not in use will be stored in a fenced enclosure at least 5m away from any structures.
\item Temporary structures will be sourced from reputable suppliers and have appropriate fire safety certification.
\item Firefighting equipment will be provided on site and staff made aware of its location. Fire extinguishers will be sited in all event tents.
\item Fire lanes will be provisioned within camping areas, clearly marked, and enforced.
\item Camp fires or BBQs will not be allowed on the ground.
\item Attendees will be instructed not to use gas appliances in tents.
\item Roving staff will be instructed to monitor the site for any fire hazards and contact control over radio.
\item Catering/concessions staff will be made aware of regulations regarding gas storage.
\item Catering area will be sited well away from camping area.
\item Sufficient access to the site will be provided and maintained clear for access of fire appliances.
\item Weather conditions will be monitored in case of very dry conditions raising the risk of spread of fire through vegetation.
\item Flame effects will not be authorised for use unless they meet the standards. See section~\ref{flameeffects}
\end{itemize}

All stewards will be briefed on steps to take if a fire is discovered which
will include alerting other staff by radio and, if necessary, evacuating
attendees.
