\section{Event Overview}

Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is the UK's largest technology-focused camping festival:
A three-day camping festival for people with an inquisitive mind and an interest in science, engineering,
technology, crafts, DIY, and computer security.

Held every two years, EMF can be seen as a cross between a conference and a festival,
with talks and workshops on a wide range of subjects across a series of marquee-based stages.
In addition, there will be demonstrations and art installations by attending members of the
community, and some music (which will comprise a limited amount of the programme).

EMF is a non-profit event run by a dedicated team of volunteers who have
experience staffing and organising similar events across Europe.

\subsection{Context}

EMF 2016 is the fourth event, and the third major camping festival organised by
Electromagnetic Field Ltd.

EMF follows in the footsteps of a number of similar events across Europe and the USA,
the most recent being the successful 5000-capacity Chaos Communication Camp 2015 festival
in Germany.

Our last festival in 2014 brought 1150 attendees to a site near
Milton Keynes for talks and workshops on topics ranging from genetic modification to electronics,
blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering to lock picking,
computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to beer brewing.

\subsection{Demographic}

EMF events have historically attracted a broad spectrum of attendees due to the variety of talks
and workshops available. The audience demographic is expected to range in age between
18 and 50, with the majority of attendees being between 22 and 35, and a slight male bias.

EMF is a family-friendly event with activites for children, and in 2014 there were a significant
number of families attending -- a number which we expect to improve on in 2016.

\section{Management}

Electromagnetic Field is an entirely volunteer-run event, but we strive to operate the event to
a standard equivalent to professionally-run events. A number of members of the organising team have
significant experience running similar events across Europe, including the 5000-capacity
Chaos Communication Camp 2015.

Overall responsibility for the operation of the event lies with the Directors of Electromagnetic Field,
Russ Garrett and Jonty Wareing.

Those volunteers involved in running the event are formed into teams, with each team having an
experienced lead and a deputy lead who are accountable for that team.

Organisational meetings of all team leads (the ``organising team'') are held periodically prior to the event.
During the event, meetings of the organising team will be held daily to deal with any issues arising.

An experienced member of the organising team will be designated as the ``duty site manager'', and will be
on call 24 hours a day during the event to respond to incidents.

\section{Site}

The event will be located in grassland at Loseley Park, Guildford. EMF has a contract to use the site between
Monday 1\superscript{st} August and Thursday 11\superscript{th} August.

Where not otherwise secure, the site will be surrounded by a Heras-style fence for security purposes.
This perimeter will surround the event tents and all camping areas. All licensed activities will happen
within the perimeter.

The entrance gate will be staffed 24 hours per day, and tickets will be exchanged for wristbands on entry.

Further detail of the site layout, including the locations of tents, toilets, and water supply,
can be found on the site plan in Appendix~\ref{site-plan}.

\section{Licensing}

EMF will be covered by a Premises License for the sale of alcohol
and the provision of regulated entertainment. The proposed licensed hours are:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Date & Sale of Alcohol & Regulated Entertainment \\
Friday 5\th August & 1200 -- 0200 & 1200 -- 2359 \\
Saturday 6\th August & 1200 -- 0200 & 1200 -- 2359 \\
Sunday 7\st August & 1200 -- 0100 & 1200 -- 2230 \\
\end{tabular}

The Dedicated Premises Supervisor will be Russ Garrett, and the event will have at least one additional
personal licensee on the organisation team.

\subsection{Alcohol Sales}

The bar will be operated by EMF and staffed by volunteers. All bar staff will receive a
briefing on legislation and event policies before starting work. The bar will operate a
``Challenge 21'' policy for dealing with under-18s, and will only accept
approved documents as proof of age. Bar staff will be instructed not to serve customers who are
drunk, and will be familiarised with the strength of the drinks they are serving.

A full price list will be provided at each bar, which will include the ABV levels of each drink
and the measured quantity in which spirits are being sold.

Drinks will not be served in glass containers. Attendees will be advised not to bring
glass onto the site.

Previous events have had no recorded alcohol-related disorder, and we do not expect this event
to be any different.

\subsection{Regulated Entertainment}

The main focus of EMF is talks and workshops, however we will provide some live music and DJs,
as well as ancillary recorded music between talks. Music is a secondary focus of the
event, and will not be a major component of any promotion or advertising.

Further information on EMF's noise management policy can be found in section~\ref{noise}.

\subsection{Public Nuisance}

The event site is not in direct proximity to any residential areas.

EMF is a camping festival, and no day tickets will be on sale. The majority of attendees are not expected to leave the site
during the event, and due to the location of the exit gate on a busy main road, leaving the site on foot will be discouraged.

Previous events have had no recorded incidents of public nuisance.

Because of this, we consider that there is a low risk of attendees causing public nuisance outside the site.

\section{Noise}
\label{noise}
We are mindful of the need to keep noise nuisance to an absolute minimum and EMF will cooperate fully
with site management, Environmental Health, and local residents to achieve this.

Programmed music performances will be confined to one of the main tents (approximately 12x24m in size),
and will be oriented to direct sound away from residential areas. Due to the
small audience size, sound levels will be kept low and easily controllable.

Staff involved with noise monitoring, the duty site manager, and staff at any locations within the site
using amplified music will be in radio contact and instructed to effectively and swiftly reduce noise
levels if necessary.

Local residents and Environmental Health will be provided with 24/7 contact details for the site office
in case of an issue with noise.

The organisers will endeavour to ensure that amplified music is not played by attendees of the event
outside of the licensed hours.

\subsection{Control}

In order to manage the noise impact on the local area, EMF will implement the following noise control plan.

EMF will endeavour to ensure noise output remains below the following thresholds, measured over a 5 minute
period, at noise sensitive boundaries:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
  Before 2300 & 15dB(A) above ambient\\
  After 2300 & 10dB(A) above ambient\\
\end{tabular}

In addition, EMF will ensure that the noise level in the frequency band 63--125Hz will not exceed 70dB(L)
at noise sensitive boundaries at any time.

Noise levels will be periodically checked at noise sensitive boundaries using a calibrated sound level meter.
Results of all sound level measurements including the time and the location of the measurement will be logged.

\section{Children}

The event will be family-friendly with a dedicated children's area. Under-5s will receive free tickets
and under-16s will receive a discount.

All reasonable efforts shall be made to ensure that there are no unaccompanied under-16s on site.

A DBS-checked volunteer will always be on-call in case of a lost child situation. The lost child
policy can be found in Appendix~\ref{lost-child-policy}.

\section{Water}
Mains water is available on site from several standpipes. Taps and washbasins will be provided by EMF.

All temporary water installation will be handled by a contractor in compliance with Water Authority Regulations.
Before the event opens, the water supply will be tested by a laboratory to ensure water quality, and the results
made available to Environmental Health.

In the event of a water supply failure, an emergency contract will be in place with a water supplier.

\section{Toilets \& Sanitation}

As there are no toilet facilities on site, a minimum of 25 toilets and 5 urinals, as well as two disabled toilets,
will be provided. This is well in excess of the recommendations made by the Event Safety Guide.

Showers will also be provided.

\section{Food}

Food on site will be provided by commercial food concessions. Food hygiene certificates will be checked and kept on
file for all food vendors, and will be made available to site management and Environmental Health before the event
on request.

\section{Staffing}

As is common with similar events, we aim to provide as many staff as possible
by asking attendees to volunteer. All stewarding will be overseen by an experienced stewarding co-ordinator.

\subsection{Staffing Levels}

Staff levels will be allocated as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
Role & Period & Staff \\
\hline
Main Gate & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Information Point & 24/7 & \\
Roving & 24/7 & 2 -- 4 \\
Bar & Licensed Hours & 2 -- 5 \\
Per Tent & During Talks & 2 \\
Control & 24/7 & 1
\end{tabular}

As well as these staff, a dedicated duty event manager will be on call at all times during the event.

In the unlikely event staffing levels cannot be guaranteed, external stewarding services will be sought.

\section{Communication}

\subsection{Radio}
All key members of staff will be issued with a radio and a contact list, and will be trained in its use.

A ``control'' member of staff within the site office will be contactable by radio at all times and will
have emergency contact details for the organisation team.

\subsection{Telephone}
A number of fixed and mobile phones will be available at the site office so contact telephone numbers
can be made available to external parties and staff who may be out of radio range. Telephone numbers
will be easily re-routed to staff mobile telephones in case of emergency.

\subsection{Emergency Communications}
Public information shall be capable of being broadcast at all stages by the stage managers. Loud hailers will
be available for use by relevant staff to give information directly to attendees.

\section{First Aid}

First aid will be provided by EMF's trained volunteers, which include those with advanced St John's Ambulance
qualifications and previous experience in large-scale festival first aid, as well as health care professionals.

During setup and teardown there will be at least one qualified first-aider on duty. During the licensed period,
there will be at least four qualified first aiders on duty at all times.

Further information on first aid can be found in the first aid policy in Appendix~\ref{first-aid-policy}.

\section{Transport and Parking}

Attendees will be encouraged to use public transport or car-share as much as possible. Car parking on site will be ticketed,
and vehicles will not be allowed on site without a pass. A shuttle bus service will be provided between the site and a local station.

Approximately 650 vehicles are expected to park on site, and the capacity available for car parking is well in excess of this.

Sufficient stewarding capacity will be provided to ensure all vehicles are promptly parked as they arrive to reduce any queueing
on public roads to a minimum.

\subsection{Traffic Management}

The main access to the festival site is via a short access road off the B3000 New Pond Road, with emergency access available
through an alternative route via the Stakescorner Road/Littleton Lane entrance.

\subsection{Vehicle Safety}

Vehicle movements within the perimeter fence will be be restricted to essential journeys during peak hours (11:00--23:00) and co-ordinated by radio. No un-marshalled vehicles will be allowed to move during peak hours.

Only competent members of staff will be allowed to use site plant. Their training and certification will be checked before the event.

\section{Fire Risk Assessment}
\label{fire}
\subsection{Sources of ignition}

The main sources of ignition at EMF are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hot exhaust from generators
\item LPG appliances in catering area
\item Camp fires and gas appliances used by attendees
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps to minimise risk}
The following steps will be taken to mitigate risks of fire:

\begin{itemize}
\item Generators provided by EMF will be sited away from all combustible materials in accordance with supplier's guidance.
\item No other generators will be allowed on site.
\item Combustible materials will be stored away from structures.
\item Temporary structures will be sourced from reputable suppliers and have appropriate fire safety certification.
\item Firefighting equipment will be provided on site and make staff aware of its location. Fire extinguishers will be sited in all event tents.
\item Fire lanes will be provisioned within camping areas and clearly marked.
\item Camp fires will not be allowed on the ground.
\item Attendees will be instructed not to use gas appliances in tents.
\item Fire lanes will provided in camp sites and monitored to be kept clear.
\item Roving staff will be instructed to monitor the site for any fire hazards and contact control over radio.
\item Catering/concessions staff will be made aware of regulations regarding gas storage.
\item Catering area will be sited well away from camping area.
\item Sufficient access to the site will be provided and maintained clear for access of fire appliances.
\item Weather conditions will be monitored in case of very dry conditions raising the risk of spread of fire through vegetation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Emergency plan}

All stewards will be briefed on steps to take if a fire is discovered which will include alerting other staff by radio and, if necessary, evacuating attendees.
